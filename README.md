<h1>Why Are Ransomware Attacks Emerging?</h1>

<h4>The modern ransomware craze began with the WannaCry outbreak of 2017. This large-scale and highly-publicized attack demonstrated that ransomware attacks were possible and potentially profitable. Since then, dozens of ransomware variants have been developed and used in a variety of attacks.</h4>

<h4>The COVID-19 pandemic also contributed to the recent surge in ransomware. As organizations rapidly pivoted to remote work, gaps were created in their cyber defenses. Cybercriminals have exploited these vulnerabilities to deliver ransomware, resulting in a surge of ransomware attacks. In Q3 2020, ransomware attacks increased by 50% compared to the first half of that year.</h4>

<h1>Popular Ransomware Variants</h1>
<h4>           Dozens of ransomware variants exist, each with its own unique characteristics. However, some ransomware groups have been more prolific and successful than others, making them stand out from the crowd.</h4>

<h1>1. Ryuk</h1>

<h4>           Ryuk is an example of a very targeted ransomware variant. It is commonly delivered via spear phishing emails or by using compromised user credentials to log into enterprise systems using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Once a system is infected, Ryuk encrypts certain types of files (avoiding those crucial to a computer’s operation), then presents a ransom demand.</h4>

<h4>Ryuk is well-known as one of the most expensive types of ransomware in existence. Ryuk demands ransoms that average over $1 million. As a result, the cybercriminals behind Ryuk primarily focus on enterprises that have the resources necessary to meet their demands.</h4>

<h1>2. Maze</h1>

<h4>  The Maze ransomware is famous for being the first ransomware variant to combine file encryption and data theft. When targets started refusing to pay ransoms, Maze began collecting sensitive data from victims’ computers before encrypting it. If the ransom demands were not met, this data would be publicly exposed or sold to the highest bidder. The potential for an expensive data breach was used as additional incentive to pay up.</h4>
<h4> The group behind the Maze ransomware has officially ended its operations. However, this does not mean that the threat of ransomware has been reduced. Some Maze affiliates have transitioned to using the Egregor ransomware, and the Egregor, Maze, and Sekhmet variants are believed to have a common source.

<h1>3. REvil (Sodinokibi)

<h4>The REvil group (also known as Sodinokibi ) is another ransomware variant that targets large organizations.

<h4>REvil is one of the most well-known ransomware families on the net. The ransomware group, which has been operated by the Russian-speaking REvil group since 2019, has been responsible for many big breaches such as ‘Kaseya‘ and ‘JBS’

<h4>It has competed with Ryuk over the last several years for the title of the most expensive ransomware variant. REvil is known to have demanded $800,000 ransom payments.

<h4>While REvil began as a traditional ransomware variant, it has evolved over time-
<h4>They are using the Double Extortion technique- to steal data from businesses while also encrypting the files. This means that, in addition to demanding a ransom to decrypt data, attackers might threaten to release the stolen data if a second payment is not made.

 
<h1>4. Lockbit</h1>

<h4>LockBit is a data encryption malware in operation since September 2019 and a recent Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS). This piece of ransomware was developed to encrypt large organizations rapidly as a way of preventing its detection quickly by security appliances and IT/SOC teams. </h4>

<h1>5. DearCry</h1>

<h4>In March 2021, Microsoft released patches for four vulnerabilities within Microsoft Exchange servers. DearCry is a new ransomware variant designed to take advantage of four recently disclosed vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange</h4>

<h4>The DearCry ransomware encrypts certain types of files. Once the encryption is finished, DearCry will show a ransom message instructing users to send an email to the ransomware operators in order to learn how to decrypt their files.</h4>

<h1>6. Lapsus$</h1>

<h4>Lapsus$ is a South American ransomware gang that has been linked to cyberattacks on some high-profile targets. The cyber gang is known for extortion, threatening the release of sensitive information, if demands by its victims aren’t made. The group has boasted breaking into Nvidia, Samsung, Ubisoft and others. The group uses stolen source code to disguise malware files as trustworthy.</h4>
